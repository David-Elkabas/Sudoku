# Sudoku

In one sentence: Sudoku generator and solver with simple GUI created in Python using pygame.

In more than one sentence: The player chooses a level of difficulty (easy, normal or hard). Afterwards, the first script generates a random sudoku map according to the chosen level of difficulty and another script solves the sudoku for comparison with the player input after the player submits their answers.
The player can then play sudoku with a simple GUI.<br /><br />

I created the game in 4 scripts.<br /> 
 ⇥ !) sudokuGenerator - script that generates a 9X9 sudoku board according to the sudoku puzzle rules - using the backtracking algorithm<br />
 ⇥ @) sudokuSolverAlgo - script that solves the sudoku puzzle - using the backtracking algorithm<br />
 ⇥ #)chooseLevel - simple script for the level difficulty GUI<br />
 ⇥ $) GUI - the main script, the player runs this script to play the game<br />
